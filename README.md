## 🧙 What I Did

This project was forged as part of a React + Git workshop. My focus was on setting up the environment, understanding the basics, and contributing with clarity and expressive effort.

- ✅ Installed Node.js and verified `npm`, `npx`
- ✅ Practiced HTML structure: lists, tables, links, images
- ✅ Styled elements using internal CSS: hover, active, transitions
- ✅ Reviewed box model using Chrome DevTools
- ✅ Explored Git basics: `init`, `add`, `commit`
- ✅ Asked questions, adapted quickly, and contributed with care

This scroll reflects my journey from setup to contribution—layered with kinetic learning and expressive lore.
